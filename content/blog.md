This contains interesting problems I encountered while making this. To understand it, you should require a reasonable understanding of what a compiler is, what a database's internals are, and some C++ knowledge. You should not require an understanding of the nodes in PostgreSQL (e.g. what is an Aggref and how do we parse it?), or what MLIR actually is.

## Background research
This content is optional, and more  a record of prior research. A literature review was conducted, which you can read HERE `TODO: Add a hyperlink to the download button for it... it's in the resources folder of the website...`. This is quite long, and not that relevant to writing the extension. So I won't dive into it.

My Notion pages have some sections on this: https://www.notion.so/zyros/Compiled-PostgreSQL-1bed636b94f0805990a6ca1a931586bb . These are from a much earlier stage of this project, and might not be valid.
